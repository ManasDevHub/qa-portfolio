## About Me
I work as a QA Engineer working in Onsite Bengaluru Location where I test real-world applications used by many end users.  
My day-to-day work includes understanding requirements, writing test cases, executing manual tests, identifying edge cases, and reporting clear, reproducible bugs to developers.

I have worked on enterprise-level and product-based applications, including ERP systems, LMS platforms, and Android applications.
